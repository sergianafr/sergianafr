# Hi there! I'm @sergianafr 👋

I'm an aspiring developer with a passion for creating and learning in the world of **web development**, **mobile development**, **machine learning** and **all things tech**.

## 👀 A Little About Me
- 🌱 **Currently Learning**: **React**, **Spring Boot**, and **.NET** to build strong foundations in both front-end and back-end development. I’m also exploring other aspects of programming to grow into a versatile developer.
- 💡 **Always Curious**: Technology is constantly evolving, and so am I! Whether it’s a new language, framework, or tool, I’m always excited to see what I can learn and apply.
- 🤝 **Open to Collaborate**: I'm eager to collaborate on any project that can teach me more about development.

## 💞️ What I’m Looking For
I’m on the lookout for opportunities to:
- **Enhance my skills** by working on real-world projects.
- **Collaborate** on open-source or team projects that involve web/mobile applications.
- **Grow my network** and connect with developers who are as passionate about tech as I am.
